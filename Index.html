                  Hi, my name is Norbu Sherpa. Currently working as a Salesforce Administrator at Athena Home Loan.active
                  I moved to Sydney around 12 years ago to complete my Master in Accounting Studies. My fasication with technology 
                  motivate me to change my career path a couple of years ago. Back then I was working as an operations supervisor for 
                  a litigation support firm. I resigned from that position and started preparing for Salesforce certification.
                  I was successful in passing the Salesforce administrator Certification. As soon as I was certified I got an opportunity
                  to interview with Athena Home loans and the rest is history :).
                  Working in a fintech has opened my eyes to the diffrent types of technologies/platforms. It also made me realise that codin was 
                  an important skill to have to learn new tech stacks. So I enrolled for the coding boot camp.</p>
